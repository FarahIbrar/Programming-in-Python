# Stock Price Prediction with Machine Learning

## Description
This project focuses on building a predictive model to forecast the closing prices of Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock for the next 30 days using historical data. The model aims to provide insights into potential future price trends based on past performance.

## Aim
To develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the closing prices of AAPL stock for January 2023, leveraging 5 years of historical data from January 1, 2018, to January 1, 2023.

## Need for the Project
The project aims to:
- Provide insights into the potential future performance of AAPL stock.
- Demonstrate the application of machine learning in financial forecasting.
- Explore the accuracy of predictive models in capturing stock price movements over time.

## Steps Involved and Why They Were Needed
1. **Data Collection**: Historical stock data was collected using `yfinance` to gather necessary data for training and evaluation.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, filtering, and transforming data ensure that the dataset is suitable for modeling. This step included handling missing values, calculating additional features like moving averages and RSI, and ensuring the data is in a format suitable for analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualization and statistical analysis of the data helped in understanding patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset. This step was crucial for identifying potential features for the model and gaining insights into the stock's historical behavior.

4. **Feature Engineering and Selection**: Creating relevant features such as lagged values, moving averages, and technical indicators (e.g., RSI) improves the model's ability to capture meaningful patterns from the data.

5. **Model Selection, Training, and Prediction**: Various machine learning models such as Linear Regression, RandomForestRegressor, and SVR were trained and evaluated to determine the best-performing model. Training involved using historical data, while prediction focused on forecasting AAPL stock prices for January 2023.

6. **Final Evaluation and Visualization**: The performance of the selected model was evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared. Visualizations comparing actual vs. predicted stock prices for January 2023 provided insights into model accuracy and performance.

## Results
The project successfully:
- Developed a predictive model that forecasts AAPL stock prices for January 2023.
- Evaluated model performance using standard regression metrics and visual comparisons.
- Demonstrated the feasibility of using machine learning for stock price prediction.

## Conclusion
Through this project, we achieved our goal of forecasting AAPL stock prices using machine learning techniques. The model showed promising results in predicting future price trends based on historical data. The insights gained contribute to understanding the dynamics of stock price movements and the applicability of predictive analytics in finance.

## Discussion
The project highlighted the importance of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection in building effective predictive models for financial forecasting. Challenges such as data quality, model interpretability, and performance evaluation were addressed throughout the project.

## Usefulness and Future Implications
The developed model can be useful for:
- Investors seeking insights into future stock price movements.
- Financial analysts looking to enhance their forecasting capabilities.
- Academic research in the field of machine learning and finance.

Future implications include:
- Refining the model with additional data sources and advanced techniques.
