# AAPL Stock Price Prediction with Machine Learning

## Description
This project focuses on building a predictive model to forecast the closing prices of Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock for the next 30 days using historical data. The model aims to provide insights into potential future price trends based on past performance.

## Aim
To build a predictive machine learning model that accurately forecasts the closing prices of Apple's stock (AAPL) for the next 30 days (02-31/01/2023) using 5 years of historical data from January 1, 2018, to January 1, 2023. The model will be evaluated based on its accuracy and effectiveness in predicting future stock prices.

## Need for the Project
The project aims to:
- Provide insights into the potential future performance of AAPL stock.
- Demonstrate the application of machine learning in financial forecasting.
- Explore the accuracy of predictive models in capturing stock price movements over time.

## Steps Overview
1. **Data Collection:** (Completed) Obtain historical stock data using `yfinance`.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the data using various techniques.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize and understand the data.
4. **Feature Engineering and Selection:** Create and select relevant features for the model.
5. **Model Selection, Training and Prediction:** Train different models and select the best one to make a prediction .
6. **Prediction and Visualization:** Finalise the predictions and visualize the results.

## Detailed Steps Involved and Why They Were Needed
1. **Data Collection**: Historical stock data was collected using `yfinance` to gather necessary data for training and evaluation.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, filtering, and transforming data ensure that the dataset is suitable for modeling. This step included handling missing values, calculating additional features like moving averages and RSI, and ensuring the data is in a format suitable for analysis.

```python
# Feature Engineering (example: adding moving averages)
stock_data['MA_50'] = stock_data['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
stock_data['MA_200'] = stock_data['Close'].rolling(window=200).mean()

# Create lag features for closing price
stock_data['Close_Lag1'] = stock_data['Close'].shift(1)
stock_data['Close_Lag2'] = stock_data['Close'].shift(2)
stock_data['Close_Lag3'] = stock_data['Close'].shift(3)

# Relative Strength Index (RSI) calculation
def calculate_RSI(data, window=14):
    delta = data['Close'].diff()
    gain = (delta.where(delta > 0, 0)).fillna(0)
    loss = (-delta.where(delta < 0, 0)).fillna(0)
    avg_gain = gain.rolling(window=window).mean()
    avg_loss = loss.rolling(window=window).mean()
    rs = avg_gain / avg_loss
    rsi = 100 - (100 / (1 + rs))
    return rsi

stock_data['RSI'] = calculate_RSI(stock_data)
```   
**Objective of the step:** Enhance the dataset with additional features that could improve the modelâ€™s predictive power and select the most relevant features for the model.

```python
In this step, we enhanced the dataset by creating additional features that could improve the predictive power of our model. Specifically:
1.	Lag Features: Added previous days' closing prices (Close_Lag1, Close_Lag2, Close_Lag3) to capture momentum and recent trends.
2.	Moving Averages: Calculated 50-day and 200-day moving averages (MA_50, MA_200) to reflect short-term and long-term trends.
3.	Relative Strength Index (RSI): Added the RSI to indicate overbought or oversold conditions in the stock.
```

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualization and statistical analysis of the data helped in understanding patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset. This step was crucial for identifying potential features for the model and gaining insights into the stock's historical behavior.

```

6. **Final Evaluation and Visualization**: The performance of the selected model was evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared. Visualizations comparing actual vs. predicted stock prices for 01-31 January 2023 provided insights into model accuracy and performance.

## Results
The project successfully:
- Developed a predictive model that forecasts AAPL stock prices for January 2023.
- Evaluated model performance using standard regression metrics and visual comparisons.
- Demonstrated the feasibility of using machine learning for stock price prediction.

## Conclusion
Through this project, the goal of forecasting AAPL stock prices using machine learning techniques was achieved. The model showed promising results in predicting future price trends based on historical data that they are trend to increase in a similar manner as shown previosuly with the data. There will not be a significant difference between actual and predict prices but a minor. The insights gained contribute to understanding the dynamics of stock price movements and the applicability of predictive analytics in finance.

## Discussion
The project highlighted the importance of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection in building effective predictive models for financial forecasting. The model was trained on historical data and validated against known outcomes, and its purpose is to predict stock prices for the next 30 days into the future. This forecasting horizon aligns with the common practice of short-term predictions in financial markets, aiming to provide insights into potential price movements over the specified period. Challenges such as data quality, model interpretability, and performance evaluation were addressed throughout the project.

## Usefulness and Future Implications
The developed model can be useful for:
- Investors seeking insights into future stock price movements.
- Financial analysts looking to enhance their forecasting capabilities.
- Academic research in the field of machine learning and finance.

Future implications include:
- Refining the model with additional data sources and advanced techniques.
- Incorporating real-time data for more accurate predictions.
- Extending the approach to other stocks and financial instruments.

## What Did I Learn
Through this project, I gained practical experience in:
- Collecting and preprocessing financial data for analysis.
- Applying machine learning algorithms to real-world financial forecasting.
- Evaluating and interpreting model performance metrics.
- Communicating insights and findings effectively through data visualization and documentation.
